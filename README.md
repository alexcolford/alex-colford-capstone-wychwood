- Wychwood Naturals -

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

Wychwood Naturals is a small family business that focuses on the benefits of natural and locally-sourced ingredients. All products are hand-crafted with the intent of providing alterative options for individuals who appreciate products made from homegrown herbs and hand-picked botanicals.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

The idea of Wychwood Naturals came from necessity and curiousity. Necessity because sometimes store-bought products contain unfavourable ingredients for those with sensitive skin and allegies and curiousity to see if there are better options from natural resources. With Wychwood Naturals being a small family-owned business, I wanted to improve on the webpage layout as well as create a more dyanmic products products that could easily be updated when new products are available. Also, with the intent of one day having an online store front, I wanted to create the the ability to make a use profile and connect it with a shopping cart.
